This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: the misuse of `unsafePerformIO`.  The `bug.hs` file contains code that uses `unsafePerformIO` to access a mutable variable, which can lead to runtime errors and unpredictable behavior.  The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a safer, more idiomatic solution that avoids the use of `unsafePerformIO` and maintains referential transparency.  The solution demonstrates how to achieve the same functionality in a pure functional manner, avoiding the potential pitfalls of mutable state and unsafe operations.
