This Haskell code attempts to perform an unsafe operation that could lead to runtime errors. The function `unsafePerformIO` is used, which bypasses Haskell's type system and pure functional nature. This can cause unexpected behavior and crashes if not handled properly.  Specifically, the example below uses `unsafePerformIO` to access a mutable variable, which is against the principles of pure functional programming and introduces side effects.
